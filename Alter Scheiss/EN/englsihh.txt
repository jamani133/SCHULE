     ------------------------------------------------------
"I, narcissist - vanity, social media, and the human condition" by
carmen fishwick is an article published by " the guardian " in 2016
to inform about the influence social media has on the behaviour of
people. the Article inquires readers about about many
expert's opinions on the topic, most of wich can be
boiled down to  teh simple statement that the bigger a persons online
presence if to themselves, the higher they tend to be positioned on
a scale to naricissm.

It is important to remeber that this is merely a common trend tthat has been observed by
researchers and pshychologists and not a "law of human behaviour" that applies in all cases,
many researched cases also observed social media bein no more than a
highly potent type of catalyst creating a nucleation point and settng
of an avalnche of narcisim that has been
slowly building up allready.

the conclusive ending of the article also
inquires the reader of the reverse action, how narcisitic and successful
people boast about their lives on the
hell hole the is commonly reffered to as social media.
