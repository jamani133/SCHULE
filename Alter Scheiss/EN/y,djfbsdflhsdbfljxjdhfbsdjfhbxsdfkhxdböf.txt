• She had always wished to have a brother or a sister, which is no surprise since she is only child.
• Children who grow up in patchwork families may have more social contacts and be open-minded, but they might also live with the feeling that they do not belong.
• In our day and age, young people sometimes find it hard to define themselves outside their group as, due to social media, peer pressure is stronger than it used to be.
• After the divorce John took care of the children and he is doing amazingly well as a single parent.
• It is certainly important to gradually become more and more independent, but strong role models provide the necessary back-up to develop self-confidence and trust.

I'm amazed to see that he takes exacly after his father
in november he came of age, he's not a minor anymore.
after years of quarrels, my parents finally got a divorce.
We used to be quite close but we have lost touch long ago.
For her, fitting into the group is all that matters.
