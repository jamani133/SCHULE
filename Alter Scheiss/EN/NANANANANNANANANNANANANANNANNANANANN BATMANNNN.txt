intro
------
In a land not far from earth, to be precise right on earth,
a young man lives, thought not sa joyful as one would hope, this man

was ed

ed is a 19 year old cabdriver with a jumbled up mess of crimes, bad memories and crimes as a childhood.
to make a living he started making soem money as a cabdriver, because he is still too young to legally drive a taxi, he has to avaiod police and other agencies
that would, at this point in time, ruin his life even further.
Bob dylan who was a popular performer in greenwhich village when he was 19,
salvador dali who was creating sought after artworks at 19 and Joan of arc who was the most wanted peson in the world when she was 19,
and then theres ed, he illegally drives cabs to not become homeless.
Its fairly understandable that hes not happy about this, but at least he still has his friends, Marv, Ritchie and Audrey.
Audrey is eds best friend and shes the one who gave him the idea of driving taxis, he has also been madly in love with her for years.


She tries her best helping him to get his life back together,
Hes started to cook for himeself
Wash his clothes for himself
he doesn't iron his shirts much but she feels that thats allright

He has brown eyes, half tanned skin and coffee brown eyes.
His muscles aren't anyting special and he doesn't stand up straight.

Audrey often plays cards with ed and they friends,
they play a game called "annoyance" for the simple reason that its the only game that doesn't cause unnecessary arguments that destroy the atmosphere.


One day ed started recieving playing cards in his mail, **DUBIOUS** letters at that, audrey didn't know what to think of it until he started running of fto locations described on the cards
when they talked about what he had done there, he said that he read to an old lady, helped a young girl and was tasked with killing a man who was abusing his wife almost every night,
ed stated that he took a gun and put it in his face, when he pulled the trigger, he shot at the sun and the man ran off never to be seen again.

Audrey was distraught hearing this and they ended up√º arguing for no real reason, he said he was doing the town dirty laundrey while everyone sleeps..... sounds familiar.... BATMAN!
