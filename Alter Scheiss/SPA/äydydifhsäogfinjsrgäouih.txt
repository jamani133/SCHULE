Analysis of that thig ye idk

-Moose

-the cartoon shows a stereotypical oil field on te left half and a pretty mountain range on the right,#
a moose and a bear are talking about the environment and the moose asks the bear when the humans are going
to start producing energy using alternative sources, to which the bear replies that they will only do so once
they destroyd the possible alternatives in the process of wringing ever last drop of energy otu of the 
cheaper options.

the entirety of the cartton is drawn using black on white dye, the lack of colors helps convey the serious
nature of the situtaion and that it is no happy (colorful) topic, if the whole thing were rainbow colored it would
not seem like a problem that hsa to be adressed
