the story of an hour is a story highlighting the effects on the body that a
loss andreturn of a loved one might have on ones body
in the story the main haracter is made to believe that her husband died
but after he returned despite being supposedly dead the main character, allready
plagued with a weak heart dies of herat failure at the end of the story




the setting of the story is qutie essencial because it is the placewhere bradley and jopsephine lived together until the story
all the momories and experieces they had together resonate in that house and it would be hard for her or him to forget
about all these things and not be reminded of the wife or husband they lost

the "joy that kills" is a descriptioon of her happiness of her husbands return, tho the

she had heart problems, her hert got stressed, and she died, thats it
maybe the heart repersemts the love she feels to her husband and the heart problems represent the difficulties and problems
in their relationship.

the speculative reason fir the namechange resides within the words it self, "dream"
would suggest to the reader that the whole story was a nightmare / regular dream experienced by mrs. mallard
which would vastly reduce the tension that thew wstory builds up over the course of its astounding... uhm.. one page...
