Katie is the central character, a middle-aged woman enduring the pressures of being a wife, mother, and trying to make a career.
She is overworked and constantly trying to meet the needs of her husband and children while being tormented by her lack of personal freedom.
Katie’s exhaustion and frustration reflect the social expectations placed on women in traditional family roles.

Martha, on the other hand, is Katie’s daughter. She is rebellious, independent, and represents a younger generation’s
desire for freedom and self-determination. Martha resists conforming to a family's expectations, 
contrasting her mothers lifestyle and deflecting the gender norms Katie and many mroe housewives endure during time of the story.
